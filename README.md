# vlsk-site v4
> now with Astro!

(i never put my github anywhere.
so this either means you're really tech savy and are curious about the source code,
and somehow able to figure out that if it's on github pages
it is very likely that the repo is public...
or you just somehow stumble upon this blindly.
or you already knew my github. in which case, hi.)


## ~important~
The actual interactivity bit for everything was done using vanilla (Type)Script.
While I do love Svelte as much as the next person, I'm kinda used to doing things
that way.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
