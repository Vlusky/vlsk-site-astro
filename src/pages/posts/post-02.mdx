## Introduction

<Youtube className="yt" id="b56xjtP6Qac" title="Inabakumori - Relayouter" client:idle/>

Relayouter was Inabakumori's entry to the [VOCALOID Collection 2023 Summer](https://vocaloid-collection.jp/about/) which is exactly what the name implies. It's a competition/event to celebrate VOCALOID and adjacent music.

![the rankings](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1027882514548789279/1151502212191752234/image.png)
It got first place, surprisingly enough.

Shout out to CeVIO [ROSE](https://cevio.fandom.com/wiki/ROSE) & [POPY](https://cevio.fandom.com/wiki/POPY)

## Kaai Yuki

![Relayouter's image cover](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1027882514548789279/1151503466682925137/F28HUFlbQAAHt5Z.png)
Wow look at all those Kaai Yuki's

Being basically a celebration for vocaloid, this song is a bit different than Ina's other songs. Well, the cover girl is different at least. It's actually Kaai Yuki herself instead of his (and NKNK_NGRMS's) OC Osage-chan.

Kaai Yuki being the actual voice bank Inaba used.

This is "Osage-chan"

She's absolutely adorable. Probably one of my favorite Vocaloid Producer OC. 

I usually don't use Japanese suffixes when _talking_ in english, but just "Osage" is a bit weird lol. As it just means "twintails"

For the laymen, you might've recognized Kaai Yuki's character from the Yukopi's Kyoufuu All Back Music Video

![kyoufuu all black kaai yuki](https://media.tenor.com/FIO5c9hzw6EAAAAC/%E5%BC%B7%E9%A2%A8%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-kaai-yuki.gif)
Me on my way to school like-

The lack of Osage-chan is a bit significant to me because up until this point, my headcanon is that (almost) all of Inabakumori's lyrics are written from her perspective. A perspective of possibly a high school student maybe going through some Youth Complex. Ranging from [being overwhelmed with homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NLsyjOH92k) to [getting dumped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFih47l1pVI).

The existence of Yuki on the cover might imply that this song was written from a different point of view.

## Childlike Perspective

This song takes a few cues from [Secret Elementary School Student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdUCRDvFv3Q) where it's about someone trying to understand their surroundings as if they were merely an _elementary school student_. A curious child that knows nothing. Trying to explore a new world.

This was also shown in how the lyrics are written. It only uses kanji a Japanese first grader could understand.

![cover image for secret elementary school student by inabakumori](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1027882514548789279/1151516336288182323/image.png)
wait that character looks familiar...

Yep! That is Kaai Yuki! The song was made for Yuki's 10th anniversary. So the song being about an "elementary school student" suddenly makes a lot more sense. And so too is Relayouter's apparent theme.

For reference, [Yuki is canonically 9](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Kaai_Yuki). Do what you will with this information.

In Relayouter, they didn't use that "easy kanji's for first grade japanese" thing. This could imply that Yuki has grown a bit since _Secret Elementary School Student_. But it still very much revolves around the idea of learning how the world works. This time it's a bit more towards "human emotions".

> ### ぶつかり生まれる前線は
> On the front of which was born...

> ### 喜怒哀楽の嵐を起こして
> a plethora of human emotions,

These were said after describing what I can only guess is either a _wild twitter argument_ or a chaotic text with an ex-partner.

The thought that "words clashing together" can inflict emotions on someone is kind of intriguing when you think about it. Words on their own doesn't have any meaning. But put them together and you can communicate almost everything that comes to mind.

Yes that's how _language_ works...

The lyrics also talk about this someone learning how their own emotions work.

> ### 喜びも怒りもちょうど良く素敵にしてあげる
> Giving you just the right amount of joy and anger.

Having just "happiness" isn't really a desirable thing on its own. You don't really want to _inject dopamine_ forever and ever while being a vegetable. Life is all about hardships and overcoming them. Hence "the right amount of joy and anger"

## Becoming Myself

> ### あたしに無いエネルギー
> An energy I don't have,

> ### 僕になって叫んであげるから
> Because I'll become myself and shout

It's repeated for every chorus and arguably the catchiest line in the song.

There's two different "me"-s in the lyrics. あたし (atashi) which has a more feminine tone and 僕 (boku) which is more masculine. These two pronouns likely refers to a different "entity" in the singer's character.

Inaba usually uses one _or_ the other when it comes to his lyrics. For example [Kimi ni Kaikisen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NLsyjOH92k) and [Float Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRQRC_0ZQ00) uses あたし (atashi) while [Hello Marina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6sYNwl1EWg) and [Kitai Avenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o14pj9CsNVY) uses just 僕 (boku).

So the use of _both_ and specifically in a way that treats them like different entities is definitely interesting.

In the other songs, 僕 (boku) is much more "mature". Being able to even guide the significant other. While あたし (atashi) is a bit more _floaty_. It doesn't know much and just wants to get it over with.

In Relayouter, the song goes that あたし (atashi) will become a 僕 (boku) and then _shouts_. 
If we're going through the theory where both pronouns are referring to the two sides of the _same_ person, it could mean that the character is indeed growing up. Leaving their past self behind for a brighter, and hopefully wiser future.

It could also mean the character finally \~found themselves\~ amidst everything. Finally finding peace and content with whatever they have.

`while we're here, this is not in any way shape or form sterotyping genders. they are merely linguistic features.`

`this disclaimer is targeted towards the average twitter user.`

## Parallels to other songs

To me, Inabakumori's music always had that "connected feel" to it. Like they're all part of the same story. This song is no exception.

<br/>

> ### 喜怒哀楽の嵐を起こして
> a plethora of human emotions,

Is a reference to [ANTICYCLONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_93SNGYgYs) and [A flower waiting for the wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_nipbC9hLk) about the overwhelming emotions one might have.

<br/>

> ### 記録的な降水量となる
> alongside a record breaking downpour.

> ### 傘を差して覗いた
> I peered from beneath my umbrella.

Likely a reference to Lost Umbrella. And it's not just the "umbrella", that song was about overcoming a _storm_ so to speak. About how we should stick together even in the toughest of rainy weather.

<br/>

> ### あたしのこころにひらがなで
> From the bottom of my heart in hiragana,

> ### 『愛を含んだ小学生』
> "An elementary student full of love"

A not so subtle reference to Secret Elementary School Student. Which as we discussed prior, already has major connections to Relayouter. "Hiragana" being the most basic kind of [Japanese letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system).

It being "in hiragana" could mean the person is trying to express it in very simple terms, so that even a child could understand what they mean.

<br/>

> ### 両手が塞がって何も得られない
> Your hands are full, you can't pick things up anymore.

Is connected to Lagtrain. Specifically the bit about ["My occupied hands are holding you back"](https://vocaloidlyrics.fandom.com/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%88%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3_(Lag_Train)#:~:text=My%20occupied%20hands%20are%20holding%20you%20back) which to me sounded like a person holding someone elses shoulder as a "wait for me" gesture.

I stole this bit from [this comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b56xjtP6Qac&lc=UgxAYMZvjc6yiQhOi7t4AaABAg) lol

It also mentioned the distinction between that あたし (atashi) and 僕 (boku).

## (my) Translation

There _is_ an official translation from Inabakumori, but it's a bit rough to my liking.
It's not like my Japanese skills are better but I do still want to have a go at this. I need to practice my Nihongo anyways.

This translation was made by constantly checking words with Yomichan, and also constantly crossreferencing DeepL and Inabakumori's translation. Alongside checking thesaurus for more "poetic" words... Uh, If you saw any fuck ups my [twitter dm's are open](https://twitter.com/vlusky_husky). Feel free to use this translation if you want/if it's actually good enough.

As a closing note, here's inabakumori singing his own song.
