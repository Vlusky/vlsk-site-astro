`very boring but kinda obligatory post`

All the stuff I made is **Creative Commons 3.0; Attribution, Non-commercial, Share alike**. That means you're free to:

- Copy
- Distribute in any format
- Modify

As long as you

- Give credit
- Release under the same CC license\*
- Don't profit off of it\*

\* for alternative licenses/commercial usage, feel free to contact me.

These are usually made by myself with absolutely 0 budget. And i usually get 0 income from these.
It doesn't feel right if you get paid for using the stuff I made for free.

Also yes this does mean you can use my art for reference and even trace them. Just make it clear when you do so :)

# FAQ

_Stands for "Fully Anticipated Questions"_

## Does monetized YouTube videos count as "for profit"?

Yes. Although for now you can still use them for that.

## Are these legally binding?

Probably not. I'm just a nobody making stuff in my bedroom. The worst you can do is hurt my feelings. Likewise the worst I can do is make a call out post on social media. The choice of respecting these is yours.

## How much does a commercial license cost?

Depends on your budget! I will try to be as lenient as possible. As long as you support my work I'll be a happy man.

## Use for rhythm game beatmaps/charts?

First of all, thank you!

Second of all, if this is for fan-made charts for osu! and the likes, this falls under "non-commercial use" and beatmaps aren't licensable the same way full fledged songs are. So I'm 100% okay with it.

Else, if you are making your own rhythm game, and you want to use my song as an official chart, please discuss it with me first. I would love to hear it.

## Use for Geometry Dash?

Good news! I'm whitelisted on Newgrounds! You can use anything I have on there.

Do keep in mind my Newgrounds discography is limited due to the various restrictions by the platform (and me losing a few of my high quality exports). In return there's a few Newground exclusive releases available.
