    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm mostly just a hobbyist that apparently have one too many hobbies. I enjoy learning new things. Whether or not I can keep up with it is another story. But I do love the feeling of acquiring a new knowledge or skill. If nothing more than just a cool new party trick I like to give to people.</p>
    <p>I have always been obsessed with computers since I was a kid. Messing around with the home computer, going through each and every setting to see what they do. My early days start with the copy of Windows Movie Maker we had. I had such a blast messing around with it, and making things. Followed by making random animations with PowerPoint.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, I have decided on a few things I wanted to focus. That being art, music, motion design, a bit of programming, and now the "Vlusky the Husky" Youtube channel where I make videos upon various things. Mostly anime. The workflow I have devised for each was a result of years of trial and error. Researching tools, trying what works best for me and what my 10 y.o. laptop could run.</p>
    <p>If you're wondering, this site is coded by myself with the Astro framework and TypeScript (with a touch of Svelte). Please excuse the bugs as I'm not a professional web dev.</p>
